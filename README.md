Setting Custom Claims for Firebase Users using Cloud Functions


This repository contains a Node.js project demonstrating how to set custom claims for Firebase users using Cloud Functions. Custom claims are a powerful feature in Firebase Authentication that allow you to grant or restrict access to certain resources or features within your app based on user attributes.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
Firebase CLI
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/firebase-custom-claims.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd firebase-custom-claims

Install dependencies:
npm install

Initialize Firebase in your project:
firebase init


Follow the prompts to select Firebase features and set up your project.

Once Firebase is initialized, navigate to the functions directory:

cd functions

Open the index.js file and locate the Cloud Function for setting custom claims. This function will be triggered when a new user is created or when custom claims need to be updated.

Customize the Cloud Function logic as needed to set custom claims based on your application requirements.

Deploy the Cloud Function to Firebase:
firebase deploy --only functions

Test the Cloud Function by creating a new user in your Firebase Authentication system and observing the custom claims set for that user.
